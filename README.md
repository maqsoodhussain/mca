Target Users: MCA students, educators, and contributors interested in Computer Applications.

Features and Functionality


Categorized materials for different subjects and semesters for easy navigation.
Include PDFs, PPTs, DOCs, and links to external resources.
Search functionality to easily find specific materials.
Contribution Platform:

Allow users to upload materials under the appropriate category.
Implement a review system where uploaded materials are reviewed by designated educators or senior students before making them publicly available.
Discussion Forum:

A platform for students to ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss topics.
Could be organized by subjects or general discussion areas.
Notifications:

Notify users about new materials, updates, or announcements.
Optional integration with email for important notifications.
Technical Stack
Frontend:

HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the website.
JavaScript: To make the website interactive, manage API requests for uploading/downloading files, and handle user sessions.
Backend (Using Google App Script):

Google App Script: To manage user authentication, file storage, and database operations. Google Drive can be used to store materials, and Google Sheets as a database to keep track of materials and users.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): For additional services like sending emails or storing large files if needed.
Deployment
The project can be hosted on GitHub Pages or a similar service for static sites.
For dynamic operations involving Google App Script, deploy the app script as a web app. Ensure proper permissions are set for accessing Google Drive and Sheets.
Security and Privacy

Ensure all data is transferred over HTTPS.
Regularly review and update permissions, especially for contributors and material access.
Future Enhancements
Implement machine learning algorithms to recommend materials based on user activity and interests.
Gamification elements to encourage contributions (e.g., badges, leaderboards).
Mobile app version for accessing materials on the go.
